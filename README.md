Quantum wave packet propagation using the Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, combined with a linear vibronic coupling model, to simulate the excited-state dynamics of PM650 & PM597 beyond the S₁ state. The IC is shown to proceed via conical intersections.
Copy inputfile.inp and operatorfile.op in a same directory.
To perform the wavepacket propagation, execute the command:
mctdh86 -mnd inputfilename.inp &
